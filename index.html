            <p>Hello, my name is Jared Larsen. I love to code and play video games, especially when I can challenge myself to learn something new or solve a tough problem. I also enjoy going on hikes and exploring new places, which helps me recharge and appreciate the world around me. It’s amazing to be living in the United Kingdom, and I still can’t believe how quickly time is passing—especially seeing how fast my kids are growing.</p>

            <p>Family is a huge part of my life. I have four children who keep me busy, motivated, and constantly learning. Watching them grow, develop their own personalities, and discover their interests has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. They inspire me every day to work hard and be the best version of myself.</p>

            <p>I’m also incredibly grateful for my wonderful wife, who supports me in everything I do. Together, we balance family life, work, and our shared adventures. Whether I’m coding, gaming, hiking, or spending time with my family, I’m thankful for the journey we’re on and excited for what the future holds.</p>
